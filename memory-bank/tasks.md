## Overview

A cross-platform system monitor that tracks battery level, CPU, memory, disk I/O, network activity, and per-process resource usage. Stores time-series data in SQLite and detects rapid battery drain correlated with CPU-intensive processes. Built in TypeScript with `systeminformation` + `better-sqlite3`.

Originally planned as a macOS-only Python tool; rewritten in TypeScript during T1 when cross-platform potential became clear. Expanded monitoring added 15+ new metrics on 2026-05-19.
