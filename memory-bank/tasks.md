## Pending Tasks (Prioritized)

### 🔥 HIGH Priority

| ID | Title | Why | Est. Effort | Dependencies |
|----|-------|-----|-------------|--------------|
| T17 | Multi-Device Dashboard — Syncthing-Style | Monitor all devices from one mobile view; QR pairing | 4-6h | T4 (done) |
| T9 | Sleep/Wake Correlation Tracking | Catch drain during sleep — biggest blind spot | 2-3h | None |
| T10 | "What Drained My Battery?" Automated Report | Synthesize raw data into actionable insights | 3-4h | T7 |

### ⚡ MEDIUM Priority

| ID | Title | Why | Est. Effort | Dependencies |
|----|-------|-----|-------------|--------------|
| T16 | Native macOS Notifications (UNUserNotificationCenter) | Better than osascript: actions, grouping, richer UI | 2h | T2 (done) |
| T13 | Process Tree View (Hierarchical) | Flat lists are misleading — show parent/child | 2-3h | None |
| T11 | Natural Language Search / Query Box | "Show me Chrome yesterday >30% CPU" | 4-5h | None |
| T12 | Data Export (CSV / Parquet / Grafana) | Free data from SQLite lock-in | 2-3h | None |
| T15 | macOS Energy API Integration | Real energy impact, not just CPU% | 3-5h | None |

### 🔮 LOW Priority / Future

| ID | Title | Why | Est. Effort | Dependencies |
|----|-------|-----|-------------|--------------|
| T14 | Anomaly Detection with ML | Statistical outliers beyond simple thresholds | 6-8h | T6 |
| T5 | Swift Menubar App | Native macOS experience | 8-12h | None |

## Recommended Implementation Order

1. **T9** — Sleep/Wake tracking (high insight, medium effort)
2. **T10** — Daily battery report (builds on all existing data)
3. **T16** — Native notifications (quick win, replaces osascript)
4. **T13** — Process tree view (UI improvement, users will love it)
5. **T11** — Natural language search (power user feature)
6. **T12** — Export functionality (data liberation)
7. **T15** — Energy API (macOS-specific, requires investigation)
8. **T14** — Anomaly detection (advanced, after baseline data accumulates)
9. **T5** — Swift menubar app (big project, nice-to-have)

## Status Summary

- **Completed**: 7 (T1, T2, T3, T4, T6, T7, T8)
- **Pending**: 8 (T5, T9, T10, T11, T12, T13, T14, T15, T16)
- **Total**: 15

*Note: T16 was not originally planned — emerged from T2 implementation as an enhancement opportunity (replace osascript with UNUserNotificationCenter).*
