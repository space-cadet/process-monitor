  - `/api/process-tree` endpoint returns hierarchical tree
  - Tree/List toggle in Processes tab
- **T15 — macOS Energy API Integration**: ✅ COMPLETE (2026-06-24)
  - `EnergyCollector.ts` — `powermetrics` integration for per-process energy (mJ)
  - `energy_mj` field in DB, shown in process cards
- **T17 — Multi-Device Dashboard**: ✅ COMPLETE V1 (2026-06-24)
  - `DeviceIdentity.ts` — UUIDv4 device identity, persisted to `~/.procmon/config/device.json`
  - `DeviceRegistry.ts` — JSON-based device registry with peer discovery
  - `/api/identity` — returns device info + all network endpoints (localhost, LAN, Tailscale)
  - `/api/qr` — SVG QR code for pairing
  - `/api/metrics` — peer metrics endpoint for polling
  - Peer polling in dashboard — fetches metrics from registered devices every 30s
  - Devices tab with online/offline status cards
  - Network auto-detection: LAN (`192.168.x`), Tailscale (`100.x`), localhost

### What's Left to Build

| Priority | Task | Description | Est. Effort |
|----------|------|-------------|-------------|
| ⚡ MEDIUM | T11 | Natural Language Search / Query Box | 4-5h |
| 🔮 LOW | T14 | Anomaly Detection with ML | 6-8h |
| 🔮 LOW | T5 | Swift Menubar App | 8-12h |
| 🔮 LOW | T18 | Relay Server for Cross-Network (Android+NordVPN) | 3-4h |

### Technical Debt (Resolved)

- ~~`sendAlert()` stub~~ — **FIXED** 2026-06-18 (T2 implemented with real alerts)
- ~~No config persistence~~ — **FIXED** 2026-06-18 (config.json + save/load)
- ~~No DB size management~~ — **FIXED** 2026-06-18 (auto-cleanup + manual cleanup in Settings)
- ~~`techContext.md` was stale~~ — **FIXED** 2026-05-19
- ~~Dashboard frontend regression~~ — **FIXED** 2026-06-10
- ~~GitHub repo out of sync~~ — **FIXED** 2026-06-15

### Known Issues

- No formal test framework (Jest configured but no test files written)
- Battery impact data needs longer runtime on battery power (currently 0 events — needs 2% drop over 2+ min while not charging)
- Telegram alerts not tested with real bot token (only verified code path works)
- **Disk/Network chart y-axis**: Auto-scales correctly now, but very low activity periods show flat lines (expected — counters don't change when idle)
- **T17 limitation**: Android can't run Tailscale + NordVPN simultaneously; LAN-only works for same-network monitoring
- **T17 limitation**: No relay server for cross-network VPN devices; direct P2P only

### Current Blockers

- None

### Notes

- DB growth rate: ~11.2 MB/day at 30s interval with full process logging
- Auto-cleanup triggers every ~50 min (100 ticks), checks age + size thresholds
- Config is now fully editable via dashboard and persists to `~/.procmon/config.json`
- Alert system supports both Telegram and macOS native notifications with automatic fallback
