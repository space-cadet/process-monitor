## 2026-06-18

#### 02:24 IST — T2: Telegram Alerts + Settings Tab + New Tasks T9-T16

**T2: Telegram/OpenClaw Alert Integration** ✅
- NEW `src/core/AlertSender.ts` — Telegram Bot API + macOS osascript notifications
- MOD `src/core/Monitor.ts` — wired AlertSender into drain/spike/battery-impact handlers
- Tested: macOS notification fires, Telegram path logs correctly when no token

**Settings Tab Enhancement**
- Dashboard Settings panel now has full config management:
  - Retention: max age (days) + max size (MB), OR logic
  - Logging toggles: battery, processes, spikes, impact
  - Sample interval, save button, restart notice
- Backend: `/api/config` GET/POST, `saveConfig()` writes to `~/.procmon/config.json`
- Monitor: auto-cleanup every 100 ticks with size+age thresholds
- DB: `insertSnapshot(snapshot, includeProcesses)` flag to optionally skip process storage

**DB Growth Analysis**
- 90.2 MB, 14,769 snapshots, ~11.2 MB/day growth rate
- Projections: 30d=335MB, 90d=1GB, 1yr=4GB

**New Task Files Created**: T9, T10, T11, T12, T13, T14, T15, T16
- Full specs with technical approach, estimated effort, dependencies
- Updated `tasks.md` with prioritized list and recommended implementation order

#### 07:45 IST - T8: LaunchDaemon Installation + Git History Recovery

**T8: LaunchDaemon Installation for Auto-Start**
- Created `ai.openclaw.procmon.monitor.plist` — LaunchDaemon for core monitor (runs as sage, PID 53211)
- Created `ai.openclaw.procmon.dashboard.plist` — LaunchDaemon for web dashboard (runs as sage, PID 57453, port 3456)
- Installed at `/Library/LaunchDaemons/` with root:wheel ownership and 644 permissions
- Resolved port conflict: old `com.mac-process-monitor.dashboard.plist` was holding port 3456, removed it
- Verified both services running via `launchctl list`
- Dashboard responding with HTTP 200 on http://localhost:3456
- Auto-start on boot confirmed

**GitHub Sync: T6/T7 Commit**
- Pushed T6/T7 features to GitHub (commit `f7e295a`)
- Full 27-commit history restored after `--depth 1` goof-up
- User's canonical copy at `/Users/deepak/code/mac-process-monitor` needs `git pull`

- Profile CRUD with color coding
- Auto-refresh every 5 seconds

**T3: Per-Process Query Interface**
- CLI: `npx tsx src/query.ts` with `--spikes`, `--battery`, `--top`, `--process`, `--stats`

- `process_spikes` table with cooldown

**T7: Battery Impact Correlation**
- `BatteryImpactAnalyzer.ts` with drain period detection
- Per-process impact scoring (CPU-seconds × duration)
- `battery_impact` + `battery_impact_events` tables
